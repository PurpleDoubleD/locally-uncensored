# Changelog

All notable changes to Locally Uncensored are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Remote Access in `npm run dev` now surfaces a clear actionable message instead of a cryptic 404 + JSON.parse stacktrace** — reported on Discord in `#bug-reports` by @phantomderp on v2.4.2: clicking the LAN button printed `POST http://localhost:5173/local-api/start-remote-server [HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found]` and clicking Internet showed an `Error: HTTP 404` toast plus `Uncaught (in promise) SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 1 of the JSON data`. Root cause: Remote Access is a Tauri-only feature (a Rust axum server, JWT auth, Cloudflare tunnel binary management, mobile-UI static serve — ~3700 lines in `src-tauri/src/commands/remote.rs`). When v2.4.2 added the corresponding `/local-api/*` paths to `src/api/backend.ts`'s endpoint map, no matching middleware was added to `vite.config.ts`, so dev-mode clicks fell through to vite's default 404 HTML page, which the frontend then tried to JSON.parse. End-user impact: zero — the installed `.exe` routes through Tauri's `invoke()` and works as designed. Developer impact: a confusing dead-end when iterating on the UI from `npm run dev`. Mirroring the entire feature in Node middleware would be a maintenance trap, so we keep dev lean and instead: (1) `Sidebar.handleDispatch` and the `remoteStore.startServer` / `restart` / `startTunnel` actions all check `isTauri()` first and short-circuit with `REMOTE_DEV_MODE_ERROR` — a single source-of-truth string that points at `npm run tauri:dev` (Tauri-aware dev mode where Remote works fully) or the installed app; (2) all 12 Remote-related vite middlewares are stubbed to return `HTTP 501 + { error, devModeOnly: true }` as a backstop in case any future caller bypasses the store guards.

### Tests
- 5 new regression cases in `remoteStore.test.ts` covering the dev-mode short-circuit: `startServer` / `restart` / `startTunnel` all throw `REMOTE_DEV_MODE_ERROR` when `isTauri()` is false, `backendCall` is never reached, and the error message itself contains the actionable `npm run tauri:dev` hint plus a "desktop app" reference.

## [2.4.2] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed
- **Updates tab no longer shows a stale "Latest Version" after a manual binary upgrade** — reported on Discord by @diimmortalis: "I tried and failed to auto-update from the .deb package in i think 2.3.7, and now the updates tab says `Current Version: 2.4.1 | Latest Version: 2.3.8`." Root cause: zustand's `persist` middleware partializes `latestVersion` into localStorage, so when a user updates the binary out-of-band the persisted "latest" snapshot survives even though it's now older than what they're running. `checkForUpdate()` has a 6h cooldown, so the stale value lingers for hours. Fix: added `onRehydrateStorage` to `updateStore` that compares persisted `latestVersion` against `currentVersion` via the existing `isNewerVersion` helper and resets `latestVersion = null, updateAvailable = false, releaseNotes = null, lastChecked = null` when the persisted snapshot isn't strictly newer. Plus a UI hardening pass in `SettingsPage`'s `UpdateSection`: the "Latest Version" row now only renders when the persisted value really is newer than current, so even a missed rehydration can't display the inversion.
- **Agent toggle now correctly enables for uncensored / abliterated variants of agent-capable bases** — reported by @diimmortalis on Discord with `LEONW24/Qwen3.5-9B-Uncensored:Q4_K_M`. The previous `isAgentCompatible` carried a deliberately narrow allow-list for abliterated/uncensored model names (`['qwen3-coder', 'hermes3', 'hermes-3', 'hermes']`) that over-rejected popular Qwen 3.x, Llama 3.x, Gemma 4, Mistral, and Qwen 2.5 abliterations even though those families retain native tool-calling weights through abliteration. Fix: the abliterated/uncensored branch now strips the `-abliterated` / `-uncensored` / `-instruct` / `-chat` / `:tag` suffixes and checks the remaining base name against the same canonical `AGENT_COMPATIBLE` list as the vanilla path. Three regression tests added in `model-compatibility.test.ts` covering the diimmortalis case + `mannix/llama3.1-8b-abliterated` + `huihui_ai/qwen2.5-abliterated`.
- **CivitAI model search now uses the API key from the Workflow finder + shows a clear empty-state hint** — reported by @diimmortalis: "CivitAI model search doesn't seem to work — i think it's because the api-key was only accepted for the Workflow finder under the Create Tab, but i'm not finding any errors in the console or network tab, just says it's getting back an empty model list." Fix: `searchCivitaiModels(query, type, apiKey?)` in `discover.ts` now appends `&token=<apiKey>` when set and adds `nsfw=true` to surface adult content (matching LU's positioning). The DiscoverModels CivitAI panel reads the same key the Workflow finder writes via `workflowStore.civitaiApiKey`. New `civitaiSearched` state distinguishes "before-first-search" from "search-returned-zero" and renders an empty-state hint — `No matches for "<query>". Try a broader query, or add your CivitAI API key in the Workflow finder for the full catalog.` — instead of leaving the user staring at a silent empty list.
- **Import Workflow now shows a visible success confirmation** — reported by @diimmortalis: "doesn't seem to persist manually entered json, and doesn't document where the file would be stored. There's no feedback or console output when clicking the 'Import' button." The import was actually persisting fine, but the UI cleared the inputs on success and emitted zero feedback, so the click looked like a no-op. Fix: added `importSuccess` state to `WorkflowSearchModal` and an emerald-green confirmation row that reads `Imported "<name>" and assigned to <modelName>.` after a successful URL or JSON paste; auto-clears after 4s.
- **Newly downloaded ComfyUI models surface in the dropdown more reliably** — reported on GitHub Discussion #22 by @Draekzy and @cprovencher-beep. Two timing-related races were stacking: (1) `refreshComfyModels` was single-shot and silently returned `false` if ComfyUI was mid-startup or busy, leaving the cache stale; (2) the `comfyui-model-downloaded` event handler in `useCreate` called `fetchModels()` exactly once, so if ComfyUI's directory scan took longer than the `/api/refresh` round-trip the immediate fetch saw the pre-scan list. Fix: `refreshComfyModels(maxAttempts = 3)` retries with 1s + 2s backoff on transient failure, and the post-download handler now schedules `fetchModels()` immediately + at +2s + at +6s with proper timer cleanup on unmount. Live-traced in DevTools: a single dispatched event now produces 8 `/api/refresh` calls inside 8s, where pre-fix it produced 1. Doesn't address adjacent root causes like file-permission issues (running ComfyUI as admin to access models) or a misconfigured `Settings → ComfyUI → Path` — those are separate problems.

### Carrying forward from master (commit 9eb1329)
- **Remote Access "Server stopped — restart does nothing" silent-failure path is fixed** — reported on issue #29 by @phantomderp13. Internet remote rethrows on failure instead of swallowing the error, orphan tunnels are cleaned up, and the inline error surfaces in the UI.
- **Anti-Virus false-positive groundwork** — reported on issue #33 by @spiritwarri0r. Bundle metadata + signed installer carry forward; v2.4.1 already addressed most ESET / Avast hits.

### Docs
- **Blog correction: SillyTavern image generation** — reported by @diimmortalis. The "Best local AI apps 2026" comparison and the "Locally Uncensored vs SillyTavern" deep-dive both incorrectly listed SillyTavern as having no image generation support. SillyTavern does support image generation through its Stable Diffusion / ComfyUI extension; the table cell + descriptive text now reflect that, while keeping the built-in vs extension distinction honest.

### Tests
- Test suite 2244 → 2246 (+2 regression assertions in `updateStore.test.ts` pinning the diimmortalis 2.3.8/2.4.1 inversion case).
- 3 inverted assertions in `model-compatibility.test.ts` flipped to match the new unified abliterated handling — the previous "abliterated NOT compatible" expectations were encoding the bug, not desired behavior.

### Verification
- `vitest`: 2246 / 2246 green
- `cargo test`: 44 / 44 green
- Built v2.4.2 installer + silent-installed over the prior v2.4.1 binary on a real Windows machine, then reproduced each bug's mechanism in the running app:
  - B1: seeded `latestVersion: '2.3.8'` into localStorage + reloaded — Settings → Updates correctly shows `Current Version: v2.4.2` + "You are on the latest version", no stale row.
  - B2: 7-case assertion table run in DevTools console — diimmortalis's exact model + 3 other abliterated bases all return true, plus 3 negative cases (embedding model + unknown-base abliteration) correctly stay false.
  - B3: searching "flux" in CivitAI panel renders the empty-state hint as designed.
  - B4: pasted ComfyUI JSON twice with different names → both workflows persisted + assigned, visible in the WORKFLOW dropdown.
  - B5: instrumented `window.fetch`, dispatched the download-completed event once, traced 8 `/api/refresh` calls within 8s spanning the immediate / +2s / +6s × 3-attempt-retry pattern.

### Notes
- Drop-in upgrade from v2.4.1. No breaking changes, no localStorage migration. Auto-update prompts on next launch. Existing users roll over automatically.
- We don't claim 100% reliability for any of these — if the symptoms still show up after updating, please drop a note in the matching issue / discussion / Discord thread. We'd rather hear about it.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- **CreateTopControls: picker dropdown hardened against any non-array list value** — reported on Discord by @phantomderp on the `#bug-reports` channel: "the web ui crashes when clicking on the model list at the top in the create tab". His workaround was to patch `activeList?.map(...)` in the source, which stopped the crash but "the list doesn't work anymore" because the `.length` branch above still evaluates on undefined. We already did the straightforward fix in v2.3.9 / v2.4.0 (added `imageModelList` / `videoModelList` to `createStore` as runtime-only state, populated by `useCreate.fetchModels`), but there's still a pathological path where the field arrives as something other than an array: stale persisted state from a very old install, Zustand rehydration racing the first render of `CreateTopControls`, a corrupted localStorage entry from an external tool, or simply an old .exe that predates aa31bab. The read site now passes the list through `Array.isArray(rawList) ? rawList : []`, so undefined / null / object / string / number / anything weird all render as the empty-state card instead of taking the app down.

### Tests
- Test suite 2216 → 2226 (+7 regression tests in `createStore.test.ts` — new "activeList fallback contract (mirrors CreateTopControls)" describe block covers undefined / null / object-with-wrong-shape / string / real-populated-array cases, plus a `.length && .map never throw on the fallback` guard).

### Verification
- `vitest`: 2226 / 2226 green
- `tsc --noEmit`: clean
- Bundled JS contains the fix (grep-confirmed `Array.isArray(h)?h:[]` in the minified `index-*.js`)
- Dev-preview E2E: injected undefined / null / `{}` / `"corrupted"` / `42` / populated-array into the store and clicked the picker — zero errors across all six scenarios
- Installed-binary E2E, happy-path: Ollama + ComfyUI running with 3 image + 3 video models — picker shows all 6 models, no crash in either mode
- Installed-binary E2E, true fresh-user simulation: Ollama folder renamed, ComfyUI folder renamed, LU AppData wiped — picker shows "Start ComfyUI to load models" empty-state, no crash in either mode; Chat / Create / Compare / Benchmark / Models / Settings all load cleanly from fresh install

### Notes
- Drop-in upgrade from v2.4.0. No breaking changes, no localStorage migration. Existing users auto-update on next launch.
- Single-file behavior fix + tests — no new features, no dependency bumps. If you were already on v2.4.0 with working model lists, you won't see a behavior change.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- **Double-launch no longer spawns a second LU process** — clicking the shortcut twice (or "Run" in the NSIS installer after install) used to produce two `locally-uncensored.exe` PIDs. Both triads wrote to `%APPDATA%/Locally Uncensored/store_backup.json` racing each other, occasionally overwriting a just-flushed backup mid-write. Fixed with `tauri-plugin-single-instance`: the 2nd launch now focuses + un-minimizes the existing window instead of creating a new process. Found during the internal 2.3.9 Ultra E2E pass.
- **Settings → Agent Permissions → "Reset tutorial" button actually resets the tutorial now** — the onClick called `setTutorialCompleted()` which unconditionally sets `tutorialCompleted: true`. Clicking it on a fresh install silently *skipped* the tour, and clicking it after seeing the tour did nothing at all. Added a new `resetTutorial()` action in `agentModeStore` that sets `tutorialCompleted: false`, wired the button to it, added a regression test in `stores.test.ts`.
- **Discover tab no longer shows the HuggingFace download path twice** — both the section subtitle and a second `<p>` below the download grid rendered "Saves to: …" / "Downloads save to: …". Removed the duplicate.
- **Linux window can be dragged again** — on Ubuntu 24.04 the title-bar drag threw `Unhandled Promise Rejection: window.start_dragging not allowed. Permissions associated with this command: core:window:allow-start-dragging` and left the window anchored in place (keyboard tiling still worked, so nobody noticed on tile-first setups). Reported on Discord by @diimmortalis. Added `core:window:allow-start-dragging` to `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`.
- **"Re-run onboarding" actually reruns onboarding now** — first cut of the button deleted the marker file + flipped `settings.onboardingDone` + reloaded, but `AppShell.tsx`'s mount-time "migration" block saw the missing marker and happily wrote it back, dropping the user straight into the main app instead of the wizard. The migration is now gated on `settings.onboardingDone === true` so it only fires for legitimate NSIS-update-after-onboarding scenarios, not for the intentionally-missing marker of a Re-run click. Caught during E2E of the 2.4.0 RC. Regression test in `AppShell-backup-triad.test.ts`.
- **HuggingFace search filename heuristic no longer doubles quant suffixes** — typing "tinyllama Q4" into Model Manager → Discover → Text → (search) returned repos like `hieupt/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-Q4_K_M-GGUF`, and the client then guessed the inner filename as `TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-Q4_K_M-Q4_K_M.gguf` — doubled tag, guaranteed 404 when you clicked download. Extracted the guess into `deriveQ4FilenameFromRepo()`, added a case-insensitive quant-suffix detector (`Q[0-9]+_K_[MSL]`, `Q[0-9]_[0-9]+`, `IQ[0-9]_[A-Z]+`, `UD-Q/-IQ`, `BF16/FP16/F16/F32`). If the suffix is already in the repo name, the `.gguf` is appended directly; otherwise `-Q4_K_M.gguf` stays as before. Full E2E with a curated model (Gemma 4 E4B @ 4.6 GB) confirmed the Model Storage override path is honored — bytes land in the picked folder, LM Studio's default folder is not touched. 9 new regression tests in `discover-hf-filename.test.ts`.

### Added
- **Settings → Privacy section** — explicit in-app statement of what the app does and doesn't do with your data. Until 2.3.9 this only existed in the README, which meant if you couldn't be bothered to open GitHub you were taking the claim on faith. Now Settings lists: 100% local by default, no telemetry/analytics, only network calls are the GitHub updater and cloud-provider APIs you configure yourself; + where your data lives on disk (`%APPDATA%/Locally Uncensored`).
- **Settings → Onboarding → "Re-run onboarding" button** — once you'd clicked through the first-launch wizard it was gone forever unless you hit "Reset to Defaults" (which wipes every other preference). Now Settings has a dedicated "Onboarding" section with a button that clears the `onboarding_done` marker on disk + resets the in-app flag + reloads. Useful when you want to redo the hardware scan, show the app to a friend, or just re-read the agent-mode tour. The `set_onboarding_done` Rust command now accepts `Option<bool>` so callers can also clear the marker, not only set it.
- **Settings → Model Storage: configurable HuggingFace GGUF download path** — requested in Discord by @diimmortalis (dual-boot Ubuntu user wanting the HF downloads on a shared partition instead of `/home/$USER/locally-uncensored/models`). New `hfDownloadPathOverride` in settings — leave empty to keep the previous auto-detect-from-provider behaviour, or pick a folder via the native picker. `DiscoverModels.tsx` now prefers the override over the auto-detected LM-Studio path. Takes effect immediately without restart.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md — ComfyUI CORS note for contributors bringing their own instance** — LU's auto-started ComfyUI already passes `--enable-cors-header "*"`, but contributors who point `npm run tauri:dev` at their own long-running ComfyUI see a `403` + `request with non matching host and origin localhost:8188 != localhost:5173` warning. Flagged on Discord by @diimmortalis after they self-diagnosed + self-fixed. Docs now spell out the workaround.

### Changed
- Test suite 2205 → 2216 (+11 regression tests: `resetTutorial` flips `tutorialCompleted` back to `false`, AppShell onboarding-marker migration is gated on `onboardingDone`, 9 cases for `deriveQ4FilenameFromRepo` covering Q-tag / IQ-tag / UD- / BF16 / lowercase / mid-string / no-GGUF variants).
- Bumped `package.json` / `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` / `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` 2.3.9 → 2.4.0 in lockstep.

### Notes
- Drop-in upgrade from v2.3.9. No breaking changes. No localStorage migration. `hfDownloadPathOverride` defaults to empty, which preserves pre-2.4.0 behaviour (auto-detect from the active openai-compat provider).
- Version train: 2.4.0 is a polish release consolidating the 6 non-blocker findings from the internal Ultra E2E sweep + the 2 bug + 1 feature request from Discord community feedback over the 2.3.x cycle. No new headline features — the next headline bump is planned for 2.5.0 (see project roadmap).

## [2.3.9] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- **Create view no longer takes down the whole app when no image or video model is installed** — reported on Discord by @figuringitallout on a fresh Windows install. Observable symptom: open Create with an empty ComfyUI `models/` tree, app unresponsive → hard shutdown → a "duplicate" LU process opens. Two layered root causes, both fixed:
  - (1) `classifyModel()` in `src/api/comfyui.ts` used to happily dereference `name.toLowerCase()` without checking `name` first; a stale persisted model string (from a previous install that got deleted) was carried into every Create render path and bubbled through `useCreate.generate`, `ParamPanel`, and the dynamic-workflow builder. Now `classifyModel(name: string | null | undefined)` returns `'unknown'` when `!name`.
  - (2) `src/hooks/useCreate.ts:fetchModels` only cleared the persisted image/video model names when ComfyUI returned a non-empty list. With 0 models, the stale strings stayed alive forever. Now fetchModels explicitly `state.setImageModel('', 'unknown')` + `state.setVideoModel('')` when the corresponding list is empty after the startup-race retries expire.
  - (3) `src/components/create/CreateView.tsx` renders a dedicated empty-state card when `connected === true && modelsLoaded && currentModeModels.length === 0`. The card shows `PackageOpen` icon + "No {image|video} models installed" + a **Go to Model Manager** primary button (calls `useUIStore.getState().setView('models')`) + a **Refresh list** secondary action (calls `fetchModels()`). `OutputDisplay` / `PromptInput` / `ParamPanel` / I2V + I2I uploads / preflight banners all suppress during the empty state so no downstream code can hit the old crash path. The Mode switcher (Image / Video) stays so the user can switch sides and get a matching empty-state.

- **CreateTopControls no longer crashes the Create header toggle + dropdown** — the header-level model picker + ComfyUI Lichtschalter lives at `src/components/create/CreateTopControls.tsx` and used to destructure four fields (`imageModelList`, `videoModelList`, `comfyRunning`, `setComfyRunning`) from `useCreateStore()` that were never added to the store. Clicking the dropdown threw `TypeError: can't access property "length", activeList is undefined`; clicking the Lichtschalter during starting/stopping threw `setComfyRunning is not a function`. Reported on Discord by @diimmortalis (with a precise console-log dump, bless them — Ubuntu 24.04 + `npm run dev`). Fix: the four missing fields are now part of `createStore` as runtime-only (not persisted) state; `useCreate.fetchModels` + `useCreate.checkConnection` mirror their values into the store so the header control always has a live list + the right toggle state.
- **Backend Selector modal no longer spams on repeat** — users with multiple local backends (Ollama + LM Studio, Ollama + vLLM, etc) reported on Discord that the "N local backends detected" modal kept re-appearing every 5-10 seconds, regardless of whether they clicked Skip or Use selected. The pre-existing `sessionStorage` guard wasn't enough in the face of WebView2 reloads (which the backup-restore triad can trigger) or cache evictions. Fix: (1) added a persistent `hideBackendSelector` flag in `providerStore` so the user's opt-out survives reloads; (2) the modal now has a pre-checked "Don't show this again" tickbox; (3) a permanent explanatory line "You can add, remove, or switch backends anytime in **Settings → Providers**" (with the link clickable — it navigates you there); (4) dismissing the modal with the tickbox checked persists the opt-out. Users who want the modal back at some point can uncheck the box before dismissing.
- **LU always starts in the Chat sidebar tab, not Code** — on a fresh install or an NSIS update, the left-sidebar tab (Chat / Code / Remote) could land on Code because `codexStore`'s persist middleware saved `chatMode` between sessions. Newcomers clicking around Code without any conversations got an empty screen. `codexStore` now excludes `chatMode` from `partialize` so the default (`'lu'`) is used on every fresh boot. If a user wants to stay in Codex or Claude Code mid-session, they pick it from the sidebar each time; `workingDirectory` still persists so Codex remembers the last project path.
- Tiny grammar fix in the Create empty-state copy: "Install **an image** model" / "Install **a video** model" (was "Install a image model" in both branches).

### Added
- **CONTRIBUTING.md — Dev Setup now documents all three local dev workflows** (`npm run tauri:dev` for hot-reload with Rust rebuilds, `npm run dev` for browser-only UI work, `npm run tauri:build` for a full NSIS installer). Reported in Discord by @k-wilkinson (sourceodin) as a missing-docs ask. Clarifies that Tauri invokes only resolve under `tauri:dev`.

### Changed
- Bumped `package.json` 2.3.7 → 2.3.9 (was lagging behind `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`). Bumped `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` 2.3.7 → 2.3.9 (also lagging). Website + download URLs + schema.org metadata updated to 2.3.9.
- Test suite 2202 → 2204 (+2 regression tests: `classifyModel` null-safety + `chatMode` default-on-boot).

### Notes
- Drop-in upgrade from v2.3.8. No breaking changes. No localStorage migration.
- v2.3.8's "Codex is still evolving" caveat still applies — this release does not advance that feature; it only hardens the Create view and refreshes dev docs.

## [2.3.8] - 2026-04-22

> **Note on Codex:** several Codex plumbing bugs are fixed below, but Codex is still an actively-evolving feature and is not yet treated as production-finished. This section is a developer-facing technical changelog. The user-facing release announcements (GitHub Release notes, README, Discord) intentionally describe this as internal plumbing + UX polish rather than a Codex milestone.

### Fixed
- **Codex `file_write` now actually lands on disk in the expected folder** — the built-in tool executors (`fs_read`, `fs_write`, `fs_list`, `fs_search`, `shell_execute`, `execute_code`) in `src/api/mcp/builtin-tools.ts` never threaded the active chat-id through to Rust even though `agent-context.ts` was designed for exactly that. The documented per-chat workspace isolation (`~/agent-workspace/<chatId>/`) silently fell through to a shared `default/` fallback whenever the model emitted a relative path, and no per-chat isolation ever happened. Now every executor reads `getActiveChatId()` and spreads it into the `backendCall` payload so Rust's `resolve_path()` / `resolve_agent_path()` can route relative paths into the right per-chat folder. `src/api/agents.ts:executeTool` also now returns the real `data.path` from Rust's `{status:"saved", path:…}` response instead of a hard-coded `"File written successfully"` string that masked write failures behind a green ✓ in the UI.
- **Codex chat bubble no longer floods with raw `{"name":"file_write", "arguments":{…}}` JSON objects for models that emit tool calls as content** — qwen2.5-coder:3b and similar small coder models put the tool call in the `content` field instead of the native `tool_calls` array. The pre-2.3.8 extractor caught the call but left the raw JSON visible in the chat, and the narrative around it ("I'm about to verify…" + ```python fence echoing the file content) was concatenated onto `fullContent` every iteration — a 4-iteration task rendered as four stacked JSON blobs with four duplicated paragraphs. Fix: new `stripRanges()` helper uses the `[startIdx, endIdx]` positions the balanced-brace extractor already computes to remove the exact tool-call substrings (not a greedy regex that fails on nested braces), and an `extractedFromContent` flag drops the residual narrative entirely so qwen's Codex UI now looks identical to gemma4's.
- **Balanced-brace JSON extractor replaces the greedy `\{[^}]*\}` regex** — the old regex failed on any JSON with nested braces OR string values containing `{` (e.g. Python f-strings `f'Hello, {name}!'` emitted by qwen2.5-coder). Replaced with a locate-header-then-balance scanner that respects string escapes. Fixes `extractToolCallsFromContent` for any code that uses f-strings or dict literals in string values.
- **Arg-validator error-hint now lists the exact missing fields with types and what the model actually sent** — pre-2.3.8 the generic "Re-issue the tool call with valid arguments matching the tool schema" hint meant small models (hermes3:8b, qwen2.5-coder:3b) kept retrying the same malformed call. Now the hint looks like `file_write requires {path: string, content: string}. You sent {command}. Retry with all required fields present.` — concrete enough that small models actually self-correct.

### Added
- **Context compaction in Codex** — long multi-tool turns used to blow past 8K-context local models' windows; Codex now mirrors Agent Mode's `compactMessages(…, Math.floor(maxCtx * 0.8))` call before each sampling pass, summarising older turns while keeping recent messages intact.
- **Memory injection + extraction in Codex** — Codex was the only chat surface that ignored the memory system. It now reads `useMemoryStore.getState().getMemoriesForPrompt(instruction, contextTokens)` into the system prompt at dispatch time, and runs `extractMemoriesFromPair()` after the turn lands. Parity with Chat + Agent Mode.
- **`CODEX_CATEGORIES` tool-scope filter** — Codex now filters `toolRegistry.getAll()` to the `filesystem | terminal | system | web` categories before passing tools to the model. The pre-2.3.8 code had the constant defined but never used, so small models were getting confused by `image_generate`, `screenshot`, `run_workflow`, and `process_list` showing up next to `file_write` and emitting tool calls with the wrong argument shape (confirmed repro: hermes3:8b calling `file_write({command: "python -m unittest …"})` when both shell_execute and file_write were in scope). The filter narrows the blade.
- **Codex iter cap raised 20 → 50** — large refactors across 10+ files legitimately need more than 20 tool calls. Budget still caps via `agentMaxToolCalls` / `agentMaxIterations` (defaults 50 / 25 from settings).
- **Family grouping in ModelSelector dropdown** — models are now grouped by family header (QWEN / GEMMA / LLAMA / HERMES / PHI / DOLPHIN / MISTRAL / DEEPSEEK / …) in the Codex/Chat/Code dropdown, with a subscribe effect that re-fetches the list when any provider's `enabled`/`baseUrl` changes so users don't have to open Model Manager to see newly-enabled providers.

### E2E verified
5 tool-capable Ollama models, each in a fresh Codex chat, writing to `C:\Users\<user>\Desktop\<test-folder>\`:
- **gemma4:e4b** — both simple (`file_write hello.py`) and a real Codex-style task ("build cli.py with argparse add/list/clear + test_cli.py with 4 unittest tests + run `python -m unittest test_cli.py` and report") succeeded end-to-end. Full trace: `file_write cli.py (2556B)` → `file_write test_cli.py (3759B)` → `shell_execute python -m unittest test_cli.py` → real output `....\nRan 4 tests in 1.612s\nOK` → final summary. 3 clean tool blocks in the UI, single final answer, Memory badge fired on extraction.
- **qwen2.5-coder:3b** — after the `stripRanges` + `extractedFromContent` fix, chat UI is visually identical to gemma4's (tool blocks + single summary, zero raw JSON).
- **hermes3:8b** — clean native tool-call flow.
- **llama3.1:8b** — clean native tool-call flow (freshly pulled for this verification).
- **llama3.2:1b** — plumbing correct; the 1B model hallucinated a Unix-style `/Users/ddrob/Desktop/tiny.py` path that landed at `C:/Users/ddrob/Desktop/tiny.py` on Windows instead of in the workdir. Model-quality artefact, not a Codex bug. Documented for users on the smallest class of models.

### Changed
- Test suite 2202 → 2202 (full regression) after `tool-call-repair` gained `extractToolCallsWithRanges` + `stripRanges` + `findBalancedBraceEnd` + `findPrecedingOpenBrace`.

### Notes
- Drop-in upgrade from v2.3.7. No breaking changes. No localStorage migration. Existing Codex chats continue to work; new chats benefit from the per-chat workspace isolation now that `chatId` threads through.

## [2.3.7] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- **Configurable Ollama endpoint (remote Ollama + `OLLAMA_HOST` env var support)** — GitHub Issue #31 by @k-wilkinson. The pre-2.3.7 app hardcoded `http://localhost:11434` in four places (the frontend `ollamaUrl()` helper used by every `/tags`/`/chat`/`/show`/`/pull`/`/generate` call, the Vite dev-proxy target, the Ollama provider's dev-mode `apiUrl()`, and the Rust `pull_model_stream` URL), so setting `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434`, `192.168.1.x:11434` or any non-default port was silently ignored — the app reported "No local backend detected", model dropdowns stayed empty, Settings → Providers → Ollama → Endpoint field had zero effect, and the Test button always said Failed even when `curl` against the configured endpoint returned data. Now all four layers flow from a single `ollama_base` field that reads, in priority order, the persisted GUI value from `%APPDATA%/locally-uncensored/config.json`, the `OLLAMA_HOST` env var at startup (same semantics as Ollama itself), then the default. Accepts bare `host:port`, scheme-less host, or full URL. The Vite dev-proxy target is computed from `OLLAMA_HOST` at server startup so `OLLAMA_HOST=… npm run dev` also just works. The Rust SSRF allow-list in `proxy_localhost` was widened to accept the configured Ollama + ComfyUI hosts (everything else still blocked). 19 regression tests in `backend-urls.test.ts`.

### Fixed
- **`pull_model_stream` Rust command was hardcoded to `http://localhost:11434/api/pull`** — same root cause as Issue #31 but in a second place. Model-pull downloads ignored any user-configured Ollama endpoint. Now reads from `state.ollama_base`.

### Changed
- Test suite 2183 → 2202 green.

### Notes
- Drop-in upgrade from v2.3.6. The default endpoint is still `http://localhost:11434` — existing users see zero behavior change. If you have `OLLAMA_HOST` in your environment (Docker, LAN, homelab) it's now honored; if you've edited Settings → Providers → Ollama → Endpoint that value now actually flows through the app.

## [2.3.6] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **Configurable ComfyUI host (remote ComfyUI support)** — Settings → ComfyUI → Host. Previously only the port was configurable; the host was hardcoded `localhost`, which meant users running ComfyUI in Docker, on a LAN machine, or on a headless homelab server couldn't point LU at it. The Host field accepts any hostname or IP. When the host resolves to the local machine (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `0.0.0.0`) the Start/Stop/Restart/Install/Path controls stay visible; when it's remote LU hides those controls and shows an amber hint that you manage the Python process on the server yourself. Requested in GitHub Discussion #1 by @ShoaibSajid (desktop LU + Ollama on server-1 + ComfyUI on server-1 docker). The mobile Remote proxy also honors the new host so mobile-dispatched ComfyUI calls reach the configured backend. 17 regression tests in `backend-urls.test.ts`.

### Fixed
- **ComfyUI port now actually persists across restarts** — pre-existing bug: `set_comfyui_port` wrote `comfyui_port` to `%APPDATA%/locally-uncensored/config.json`, but `AppState::new()` never read it back on startup. Users who set a custom port (e.g. because 8188 was taken) got their change reverted to 8188 on the next launch. New `load_comfy_config_values()` helper runs at startup and applies persisted port + host. Bundled with the host feature since they share the same config-load path.
- **OpenAI-compat local backends (LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp server, KoboldCpp, oobabooga, Jan, GPT4All, Aphrodite, SGLang, TGI, LocalAI, TabbyAPI) can actually be reached from LU's Tauri webview** — `openai-provider.ts` used plain `fetch()` for `/v1/models`, `/v1/chat/completions`, and `checkConnection`, which CORS-blocks localhost requests inside the Tauri WebView (only Ollama had CORS open). The "Test" button in Settings → Providers always showed **Failed** and models never appeared in the dropdown even when the backend was obviously reachable via curl. Fix: each HTTP call now picks `localFetch`/`localFetchStream` when the provider baseUrl hostname is local (`localhost`/`127.0.0.1`/`::1`/`0.0.0.0`), which routes through the Rust proxy with a direct-fetch fallback. Cloud endpoints (OpenAI proper, OpenRouter, Groq, Together, DeepSeek, Mistral, etc.) skip the proxy since they don't have the localhost CORS issue. Surfaced during v2.3.6 live E2E against a real LM Studio server on :1234; the Djoks auto-detection fix (v2.3.5) was detecting + pre-enabling the provider correctly, but the actual /v1/* calls were silently CORS-rejected.

### Changed
- Test suite 2166 → 2183 green (+17 regression tests for `setComfyHost` / `isComfyLocal` / `comfyuiUrl` / `comfyuiWsUrl` with custom hosts).

### Notes
- Drop-in upgrade from v2.3.5. No breaking changes. The default host is still `localhost` — existing users see zero behavior change unless they explicitly switch to a remote host.

## [2.3.5] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- **LM Studio (and other openai-compat backends) now show up when Ollama is also running** — `AppShell`'s post-onboarding detection only auto-enabled a backend when exactly one was detected. With two or more (the very common Ollama + LM Studio setup) it showed the `BackendSelector` modal but pre-enabled nothing. Users who dismissed the modal saw zero LM Studio models in the chat dropdown even though LM Studio was clearly running — looked from the outside like "LU doesn't recognize my models". Reported via Discord `#help-chat` on 2026-04-21. Fix: the first non-Ollama detected backend is always pre-enabled (Ollama is left untouched since it has its own provider slot); the selector stays as an educational picker so you can change which openai-compat backend is primary. Reproduced live with a mock LM Studio endpoint on port 1234 with Ollama also running, verified the fix against the same setup on the release binary. Five regression tests in `AppShell-backend-autoenable.test.ts`.
- **No more terminal flashes on Windows when LU kills subprocesses** — two Windows-branch `Command::new` spawns were missing `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`: the `taskkill` calls in `AppState::Drop` that tear down ComfyUI + Claude Code process trees on LU shutdown, and the `docker pull` / `docker run` in `search.rs` that installs SearXNG. Both briefly flashed a console window at the user. Now 100% of Windows-branch subprocess spawns carry the flag. LU itself never spawns LM Studio (only talks HTTP to a user-run instance), so the "no terminal when using LM Studio" guarantee was already true on that path; this tightens the peripheral surface.
- **`setup.bat` / `setup.ps1` / `setup.sh` no longer mislead end-users into dev mode** — the scripts launched `npm run dev` (Vite + browser), which has fewer features than the installed Tauri app and produced confusing `[vite] http proxy error: /system_stats ECONNREFUSED` when ComfyUI wasn't installed yet. Reported via GitHub issue #30. Fix: all three setup scripts now start with a clear dev-mode banner, a link to the installer in Releases, and a one-key prompt to continue or exit. The README's "Windows One-Click Setup" section was also reframed as "For Contributors — Dev-Mode Setup" with an explicit pointer to the installer for end-users.

### Changed
- Test suite 2161 → 2166 green (+5 regression tests for the backend-autoenable fix).

### Notes
- Drop-in upgrade from v2.3.4. No breaking changes. No localStorage migration. Everything from v2.3.4 (chat-history persistence, Ollama 0.21 compat, Codex loop guard, stop-button fast-path, stale-chip fix, 12-backend auto-detect, Mobile Remote, Codex streaming, Agent Mode rewrite, ERNIE-Image, Qwen 3.6, 75+ one-click model downloads) still applies.

## [2.3.4] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Chat history now survives updates** — `isTauri()` was checking the v1 global `window.__TAURI__`, but Tauri 2 renamed it to `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__`. Inside the packaged `.exe` every Tauri-only backend command (`backup_stores`, `restore_stores`, `set_onboarding_done`, ComfyUI manager, whisper, process control) silently fell through to the dev-mode fetch path and no-op'd. Fix: dual-global check + 100 ms × 50-tick polling loop that waits for the Tauri global to appear before arming the backup triad (required because `withGlobalTauri: true` sets the global asynchronously on slow cold-starts). Full destructive wipe+restore roundtrip live-verified on the release binary.
- **Backup cadence tightened** — safety-net interval 30 s → 5 s; added event-driven debounced backup on every chat mutation (1 s after the last message); added `beforeunload` sync flush for graceful quits. All three legs run unconditionally with a `__ts` marker so the snapshot is always non-empty.
- **Ollama 0.21 / 0.20.7 compatibility** — auto-upgraded Ollama rejects pre-existing models with `HTTP 404 model not found` on `/api/show` when the on-disk manifest lacks the `capabilities` field. New `modelHealthStore` + top-of-app `StaleModelsBanner` + Header Lichtschalter chip detect stale models and offer a one-click re-pull that verifies the fix before clearing the warning. Error parser tolerates 400/404/Rust-proxy-wrapped-500 forms.
- **Stale-chip state leak** — switching from a stale model to a fresh one now clears the red toggle and the inline chip immediately; switching between two different stale models re-pins correctly.
- **Codex infinite-loop guard** — small 3 B coder models (qwen2.5-coder:3b, llama3.2:1b) could loop forever repeating the same `file_write + shell_execute` batch when a test failed. Codex now tracks per-iteration batch signatures and halts after two consecutive identical batches with "same tool sequence repeated N× — try a larger model".
- **Stop button instant** — `abort.signal.aborted` checked at the top of the `for await` chat stream and the NDJSON reader loop; `reader.cancel()` on abort. No more 30–60 s of thinking-token leak after clicking Stop on a Gemma-4 response.
- **`isHtmlSnippet` export missing** — 19 failing CodeBlock tests fixed.
- **Create view crashed silently in browser bundle** — `comfyui.getKnownFileSizes` used CommonJS `require('../api/discover')` which Vite/Rolldown can't resolve. Replaced with dynamic `import()`.
- **flux2 CFG scale test regression** — test asserted 3.5 (Z-Image default); corrected to 1.0 (flux2 default).

### Changed
- Test suite 2105 → 2161 green (+56 regression tests covering backup triad, Codex loop detection, `__TAURI_INTERNALS__` detection, stale-manifest parsing).

### Notes
- No breaking changes. Existing chats and settings survive the upgrade via the now-working restore path.
- Existing `phi4:14b`, `dolphin3:8b`, and other pre-0.15 Ollama models will show in the stale banner. Click "Refresh all" to re-pull; manifests will be regenerated with the new `capabilities` field.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- **Model unloading broken** — unload button and automatic unload on model switch silently failed (missing `prompt` field in Ollama `/generate` call), causing models to stay in RAM indefinitely
- **No GPU offloading** — models ran entirely on CPU/RAM instead of GPU; added `num_gpu: 99` to all Ollama chat calls so layers are offloaded to GPU automatically (Ollama splits between GPU and CPU if VRAM is insufficient)
- **Silent error swallowing** — unload errors were caught and discarded with `.catch(() => {})`; now logged to console for debugging

- **Variant selector** — dropdown for multi-size model downloads in Discover
- **HOT/AGENT badges** — recommended models highlighted in Model Manager
- **web_fetch tool** — fetches URLs and extracts readable text content (HTML → text)

### Changed
- **UI redesign (Linear/Arc style)** — compact header, collapsible settings, list-view models, minimal borders
- **Sidebar** — narrower, minimal hover states, smaller text
- **Settings** — collapsible sections, inline sliders, compact toggles
- **Model Manager** — list layout instead of card grid
- **Start screen** — clean LU logo only, smooth transition to chat

- **Tool call display** — inline colored text instead of colored boxes

### Fixed
- DuckDuckGo search snippet truncation (regex now captures full HTML content)
- DDG URL extraction from redirect wrappers
- Context window exhaustion after many tool calls ("Failed to fetch" error)

### Removed
- Old standalone Agent View (replaced by in-chat Agent Mode)
